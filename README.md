# DungeonMix

DungeonMix is a web application that allows you to create interactive audio boards for your tabletop gaming sessions. Place audio areas on maps that trigger ambient sounds, music, or effects when markers are moved into them.

## Browser Compatibility

DungeonMix uses the [File System Access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API) for accessing local audio files. This currently requires Chrome/Chromium/Edge 86+, this might change in the future.
